and will continue to exist as long as it’s maintained and keeps receiving contributions.

## What does it mean that GitHub CLI is official and `hub` is unofficial?

GitHub CLI is built and maintained by a team of people who work on the tool on behalf of GitHub. When there’s something wrong with it, people can reach out to GitHub support or create an issue in the issue tracker, where an employee at GitHub will respond. 

`hub` is a project whose maintainer also happens to be a GitHub employee. He chooses to maintain `hub` in his spare time, as many of our employees do with open source projects.

## Should I use `gh` or `hub`?

We have no interest in forcing anyone to use GitHub CLI instead of `hub`. We think people should use whatever set of tools makes them happiest and most productive working with GitHub. 

If you are set on using a tool that acts as a wrapper for Git itself, `hub` is likely a better choice than `gh`.

If you want a tool that’s more opinionated and intended to help simplify your GitHub workflows from the command line, we hope you’ll use `gh`. And since `gh` is maintained by a team at GitHub, we intend to be responsive to people’s concerns and needs and improve the tool based on how people are using it over time.

GitHub CLI is not intended to be an exact replacement for `hub` and likely never will be, but our hope is that the vast majority of GitHub users who use the CLI will find more and more value in using `gh` as we continue to improve it.
